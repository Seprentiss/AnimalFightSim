# AnimalFightSim
## What is the Animla Fight Simulator
The Animal Fight Simulator came about after having a discussion with my father about whaht animal would win in a fight.
<br> I used to have these debates all the time as a kid with my friends and now that I know a bit about programming I set out to answer the question
of which animals really would win in a fight.

## How are winners decided

The method by which the winner is decided is by using a Monte Carlo simulation to run 10,000 fights and calulacte the percentage of total victories for each comabtant.

For those who don't know what a Monte Carlo Simulation is a method to model the probability of different outcomes in a process wher the outcome cannot be easily predicted due to the intervention of random variables.

The random variables in this case are the stats of the Animals and the location of the fight. <br>They can range from the bite foce of the animal to how often does it climb trees in certain enviornments. <br> How did I create these stats? I will explain that in a further section.

After the variables are inputed and calculted the simulation spits out a winner and what percentage of fights it would win

## How were the stats created
Creating the stats took hours of research. I had to look into many different characteristics of each animal. Characteristics like intelligence, strength, height, speed, etc.
I also had to create my own stats like health that take into account both an animals size and their durabillity. I also created an attacks per turn stat that is based off of an animals size, speed, agillity, and stamina. I also has to create tendencies for each animal. Tendencies like how often do they climb trees, do they camoflaugue themselves in certain enviornments etc.
Some of the stats had to be adjusted slightly for balancing purposes

## Overall experience/ What I learned
This project taught me a lot. I was able to sharpen my coding skills as well as fully complete a project from start to end without a prior template being provided.
I learned how to create metrics and how to balance them to achieve results and learned how to create a montecarlo sim. I thourouly enjoyed this project and had a blast working on it. Ill be continuing to update it with further features like more animals and terrains.
